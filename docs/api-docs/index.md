### Welcome

Ford developers try to build APIs to be as self-documenting as possible, but historically, we haven't been so good at making the output co-located or easily accessible. The purpose of this portal is to consolidate all our API data into one central repository. Get started below:

- [Getting started](getting_started.html) gives you details and support for general API questions, such as gateways, hosting details, authentication and access.
- [API Catalog](fields.html) provides a list of all Ford's available APIs
- [API calls](console/) gives you a hands-on experience of API operations with an interactive console.
- [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](FAQ.html) Here are answers to some frequently asked questions.
- [Contact Us](contact_us.html) If you need support or need to get in touch, this is the place to look.
